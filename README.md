# Pratice-Cpp
 Well I'd like to test myself how good I am before making something massive :"> <br />
 Before I upload something special, that I'll release in my [main account](https://github.com/harshfeudal), I'd like to post some very basic code first, and advance then, to let people like me can self-study how to code in C++.

## Testing
 If you are the beginner coder, just start from Chapter 1 first :">
 
 ### Build and run
  #### Visual Studio 2022 (VS 2019 may not support)
  To run on Visual Studio just open the Solution file (`.sln`). And that's it :">
  #### Visual Studio Code
  Navigate immediately the `main.cpp` file and compile it using `g++ main.cpp` or anything else that you have installed at first. Please make sure to search on Google if you don't know [how to install C++ in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).
  #### Others
  Other applications may support or not depends on its C++ version (I'm using C++ 17).
 
 ### Books
  Yes, this respiratory is coded from a C++ book that I'll send into here later.
